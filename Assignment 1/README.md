__Data Science For Social Good Assignment 1__

__To obtain access to Google Earth Engine:__ 
You need to apply for access to Earth Engine [here](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/). It's really simple and should go through almost immediately if you make sure you don't check the box for commercial purposes. You can only run the code if you apply for it. 


At this point we have: 
1. Visualize an interactive map and satellite image of a selected area. 
2. Calculate the NDVI and superimpose it on the image/map (where red is no vegetation ranging to dark green with vegetation)
3. Print the average green space ratio (NDVI) for the city for a given year (will extend to do by month in the future) ranging from 1984-2021.
