# ds-for-sg-tutorial

This is a project for the Data Science for Social Good Tutorial, Spring 2022, taught by Prof. Hadavand at Minerva University.

### Instructions

- **Local (Recommended)**: If you are running our notebooks on your local laptop, we recommed that you create a virtual environemnt and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure that your Python interpreter, when running the notebook, it is properly set to the virtual environment you created. The following commands can help you set-up the virtual environment and install the packages.

```
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment for MAC/UNIX
    $ venv\Scripts\activate # Activate virtual environment for WINDOWS
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Google CoLab:** If you are running our notebooks on a sandbox environmemt like Google CoLab, you will need to install the dependencies listed in the beggining of each notebook. Remember that once your session is disconected, you will have to install the packages again.
